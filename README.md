## What is Novalist?

Novalist is an offline-first desktop application for writing novels. It handles the full scope of a writing project — manuscript editing, worldbuilding, plotting, timelines, exporting, and version control — in a single, self-contained tool. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux on top of .NET 8 and Avalonia.

Rather than scattering notes across separate apps, browser tabs, and Markdown files, Novalist keeps everything about a project in one folder of plain files: chapters and scenes as HTML, entities and metadata as JSON, images and research alongside. The folder is yours — back it up, sync it, version-control it, edit it with any text editor when Novalist is closed.

## Documentation

A full **User Manual** lives in [`docs/manual/`](docs/manual/README.md). It covers every feature in detail with cross-linked pages for getting started, the interface, projects and books, the editor, worldbuilding, plotting, exporting, extensions, hotkeys, and troubleshooting.

For extension authors, the [Extension Guide](docs/extension-guide.md) walks through the SDK, hooks, packaging, and store submission.

## Features

### Writing

- WYSIWYG editor with formatting, paragraph styles (heading, subheading, blockquote, poetry), inline comments, and numbered footnotes.
- Auto-save with per-scene **snapshot history** and a side-by-side compare view — revert a single scene without touching the rest of the project.
- **Focus Mode** that hides every panel except the editor.
- **Split editor** for editing two scenes side by side.
- **Auto-replacements** for smart quotes, em-dashes, and ellipses with language presets (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak).
- **Dialogue punctuation correction** as you type.
- **Grammar and spelling check** via LanguageTool (public endpoint by default; self-hosted endpoint supported).
- Live word count, reading time, and Flesch readability score in the status bar; per-chapter readability in the Project Overview.

### Project structure

- Multi-book projects with a shared **World Bible** for entities used across books.
- Chapters with status tracking (Outline → First Draft → Revised → Edited → Final), optional acts, optional in-world date ranges, label colors, and favorites.
- Scenes with synopsis, notes, label color, plotline membership, in-world date range, POV / emotion / intensity / conflict / tags (auto-detected with manual overrides).
- **Smart Lists** — saved scene queries by status, POV, tag, or plotline.
- **Filesystem is the source of truth** — add, move, rename, or delete scenes and chapters with any file manager and Novalist reconciles the changes, both on open and live while running. Scene identity travels in a one-line comment in each file; chapter identity in a hidden folder marker.

### Worldbuilding (Codex)

- **Characters** with name/surname, gender, age (manual or computed from birth date and the in-world calendar), role, group, physical traits, images, relationships, and per-act / per-chapter / per-scene overrides for any field.
- **Locations** with hierarchical parents, types, and custom fields.
- **Items** with origin, type, and description.
- **Lore** entries for magic systems, religions, history, in-world books.
- **Custom entity types** — define your own (Factions, Spells, Vehicles, Races, …) with custom field schemas.
- **Templates** per entity type with default sections, custom properties, and field defaults.
- **Sections** of long-form Markdown content per entity.
- **Relationships** with auto-learned inverse-role pairs and inverse-prompting on new relationships.
- **Focus peek** card on entity hover inside the editor.

### Planning & visualization

- **Plot Grid** — spreadsheet view of plotlines (rows) by scenes (columns); toggle scene membership in a thread with a click.
- **Timeline** — chronological view of acts, chapters, scenes, and manual events with vertical/horizontal layout and day/week/month/year zoom.
- **In-world Calendar** — Gregorian calendar view with Week, Month, and Year layouts; scenes and events appear on their in-world dates. (Custom-calendar data model exists but no editor UI yet — Gregorian only in the app today.)
- **Relationships graph** — auto-clustered force-directed graph of characters with family detection in English and German.
- **Manuscript view** — read the whole book end-to-end, switch to Corkboard for index-card planning, or Outliner for a sortable scene table.
- **Maps** — interactive layered map view: recursive layer tree with drag-and-drop nesting, per-layer opacity / lock / zoom-range / floor-stack mode; per-image rotate, resize, polygon clip mask; entity-linked colour pins; text labels; road & river spline tool with typed profiles (casing, fill, lane markings) and per-point width; terrain shapes (grass, forest, sand, …) with feathered, blendable edges and z-ordering; typed buildings (homes, schools, stations, …) with procedurally-generated footprints that snap to roads and optional multi-floor interior plans (walls, doors, windows, stairs); a freeform clip border that frames the whole map; and a one-click **3D view** — a GPU-rendered, free-fly walkthrough of the whole map with extruded buildings, sloped roofs, interiors, terrain and roads.
- **Dashboard** — totals, status breakdown, chapter pacing, echo phrases, daily / project word goals with deadlines.

### Research & assets

- **Research view** — notes, links, files, images, and PDFs attached to the project with tags and search.
- **Image Gallery** — every project image at a glance with lazy thumbnails, search, and copy-path / reveal actions.
- Add images from file, clipboard, URL, or the existing project gallery.

### Output

- Export to **EPUB**, **DOCX**, **PDF**, **Markdown**, **Final Draft / Fountain**, **LaTeX**, and **Codex Markdown**.
- Built-in **Shunn Modern Manuscript Format** preset for submissions.
- Chapter-level selection, optional title page, custom title and author.
- Extensions can contribute additional formats and presets.

### Version control

- Built-in **Git** client — stage, commit, push, pull from the app; branch and changed-file count in the status bar.
- Per-scene snapshot history is complementary to Git for fine-grained, per-file recovery.

### Find & Replace

- Plain-text, whole-word, case-sensitive, or .NET regex search.
- Scope to the current scene, the selection, the active book, or every book in the project.
- Replace one or all matches; snapshots cover the replacements.

### Customization

- **Hotkeys** — every action is rebindable; defaults documented in [`docs/manual/26-hotkeys.md`](docs/manual/26-hotkeys.md).
- **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) — every action by name.
- **Localization** — drop-in JSON locale files; English and German ship in the box.
- **Theme** — system / light / dark with a custom accent color.
- **Global or per-project settings** — appearance, editor, and writing-assistance settings default to global but can be overridden per project (e.g. an English book and a German book each with their own language, quotes, and theme); project overrides live in `.novalist/` and sync via git.
- **Book preview** — render the editor as a printed page with configurable trim size and book font.

### Extension system

Novalist has a plugin architecture through the **Novalist SDK**. Extensions can contribute:

- Ribbon and status-bar items
- Sidebar and context-sidebar tabs
- Full-screen content views with activity-bar icons
- Settings categories and pages
- Hotkeys
- Editor hooks (lifecycle, inline actions, grammar checks)
- Context-menu items
- Export formats and presets
- Themes
- Custom entity types and custom property types
- AI integration hooks (prompt building, response processing)

Extensions are .NET 8 class libraries discovered at runtime from the user extensions folder. See the [Extension Guide](docs/extension-guide.md) and the bundled `Novalist.Sdk.Example` project for a working reference implementation.
