# Settings

Settings is where you configure Novalist's appearance, the editor, writing assistance, writing goals, default templates, hotkeys, and integrations.

Settings are stored in your user app-data folder and apply to every project you open. A subset (templates, calendar, project name) are per-project; those appear next to their per-project counterparts.

## Global vs project settings

The **Appearance**, **Editor**, and **Writing Assistance** sections each have an **Override for this project** checkbox at the top. It is enabled only while a project is open.

- **Off (default)** — that section uses your global settings, shared by every project.
- **On** — the section's values are saved with the project, in its `.novalist/settings.json` file, and override the global values whenever this project is open. Because they live inside the project folder, the overrides travel with the project through git and across devices.

Overrides are resolved per setting: a project only stores the keys for the sections you switch to project scope; anything left global keeps inheriting the global value. Switching a section back to global clears that section's overrides and the values revert to your global settings immediately.

This lets you, for example, keep one book in English with English quotation marks and another in German with German quotes and a German interface, without changing your global defaults. Switching projects re-applies the effective theme, accent color, and interface language for the project you open.

Other sections have a fixed scope: hotkeys, updates, and diagnostics are always global; writing goals, templates, author, and calendar are always per-project. Only Appearance, Editor, and Writing Assistance offer the global/project switch.

## Opening Settings

- Click the **gear** icon in the activity bar.
- Or **Start menu → Settings** (open the start menu from the hamburger button at the far left of the app bar).
- Or the command palette → "Settings".

Settings opens as a full-window overlay. Click **Close** or press `Escape` to dismiss.

A search box at the top of the Settings overlay lets you find a setting by name across all categories.

## Categories

The Settings overlay is divided into the following sections.

### Appearance

- **Language** — UI language. Discovered from the `Assets/Locales/*.json` files (English and German ship by default). The display name comes from each file's `language.name` key. Changes apply immediately without restart.
- **Theme** — picks the active color scheme. Ships with **Default** (VS Code Dark+ inspired) and **Discord**. Custom themes can be dropped into `<InstallDir>/Assets/Themes/` as `.axaml` files and appear in the picker on next launch; extensions can also contribute themes via the SDK. The selection is stored in `AppSettings.Theme`.
- **Accent color** — pick a custom accent or leave it on the theme default. The hex string is stored in `AppSettings.AccentColor`.

### Editor

- **Editor font family** — typeface used in the editor when book preview is off. Defaults to **Inter**.
- **Editor font size** — point size. Default 14.
- **Enable book paragraph spacing** — when on, the editor renders paragraphs the way a printed book would (first-line indents, tighter spacing).
- **Enable book width** — when on, constrains the column to a printed-page width.
- **Book page format** — choice of trim sizes. Default is **US Trade 6×9**. Other options include Digest (5.5×8.5), A5, Mass Market, and a Custom size.
- **Book text-block width** — optional manual override of the text-block width within the page.
- **Book font family** — typeface used in book preview / book export. Defaults to **Times New Roman**.
- **Book font size** — book-preview point size. Default 11.

### Writing Goals

- **Daily word goal** — integer. Drives the daily-goal progress bar in the status bar. Reset at local midnight.
- **Project word goal** — integer. Drives the project-goal progress bar.
- **Project deadline** — optional date. When set, the dashboard computes days remaining and a suggested daily pace.

### Writing Assistance

- **Auto-replacement language** — preset that decides how straight quotes, dashes, and ellipses are converted. Options: English, German (low), German (guillemet), French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak. Picking a preset replaces the auto-replacement table with that language's defaults.
- **Auto-replacement table** — editable list of `start`/`end` patterns and their `startReplace`/`endReplace` substitutions. Add custom replacements if you have specific quotation conventions.
- **Dialogue Punctuation Correction** — toggle. When on, dialogue punctuation is auto-corrected as you type.
- **Grammar & Spelling Check** — toggle. When on, the editor underlines grammar and spelling issues via a LanguageTool-compatible API.
- **Grammar check API URL** — optional override. Leave empty to use the free public LanguageTool API. Provide a URL like `http://localhost:8081/v2/check` for a self-hosted instance.

### Templates

Per-entity-type template management. For each of Character, Location, Item, Lore, and each custom entity type:

- A list of available templates with **Edit** and **Delete** actions.
- A **+New template** button.

See [Templates](07-templates.md) for the template editor itself.

### Hotkeys / Keyboard Shortcuts

A searchable grid of every registered action with:

- **Action label** — e.g. "Toggle Focus Mode", "Add Comment", "Open Codex".
- **Category** — e.g. "Editor", "Navigation", "Panels".
- **Default binding** — the shipped hotkey.
- **Current binding** — your override, if any.

To rebind, click an action's binding and press the new key combination. Click the **×** next to a binding to clear it back to default.

See [Hotkeys](26-hotkeys.md) for the full list of defaults.

### Updates & Integrations

- **Check for updates** — toggle. When on, Novalist checks for new releases on startup.
- **Check for extension updates** — toggle.
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** — optional. Increases the extension gallery API rate limit from 60 to 5000 requests per hour. Stored locally; never sent anywhere other than GitHub's public API.

### Diagnostics

- **Diagnostic logging** — toggle, off by default. When on, Novalist writes a technical log to a file you can send for support (e.g. to report a bug we cannot reproduce).
  - **What it records:** app events, lifecycle and startup phases, settings state, panel/sidebar visibility, and errors / stack traces.
  - **What it never records:** your story text, characters, locations, items, lore, scene or chapter titles, notes, or file names. File paths are stripped to their extension only. The log is content-safe by design so you do not have to worry about your writing being copied.
  - **Open log folder** / **Open current log** — open the log so you can read it before sending. **Clear logs** deletes the files.
  - Logs live in `%APPDATA%/Novalist/logs/` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support/Novalist/logs/` (macOS), `~/.config/Novalist/logs/` (Linux), named `novalist-<date>.log` and size-rotated.

### Extension settings

Each installed extension that contributes settings appears as its own category at the bottom of the Settings overlay. The category name and icon are chosen by the extension.

## Per-project settings

A small set of settings are project-scoped rather than app-scoped, stored in `<Project>/.novalist/settings.json`:

- **Author name** for exports.
- **Project default templates** (when distinct from the global ones).
- **Watch filesystem** — toggle, on by default. When on, Novalist watches the active draft folder and reconciles scenes/chapters you add, move, rename, or delete with a file manager while the app is open. Turn it off on flaky network or cloud drives where the watcher misbehaves; reconciliation still runs when you open the project. See [Editing your project outside Novalist](03-projects-and-books.md#editing-your-project-outside-novalist).

## Where settings live

- **App-level** — `%APPDATA%/Novalist/` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/Novalist/` on macOS, `~/.config/Novalist/` on Linux.
- **Project-level** — `<Project>/.novalist/`.
- **Hotkey overrides** — `AppSettings.HotkeyBindings` (app-level).
- **Recent projects** — `AppSettings.RecentProjects` (app-level).
- **Window state** — width, height, position, maximized (app-level).

## Tips

- **Set the daily goal small at first.** A daily goal you hit eight days out of ten is better than one you hit twice a month.
- **Switch theme by light.** Dark mode for evening sessions, light for daylight; the eyes will thank you.
- **Disable grammar check if it slows you down.** It calls a remote API; some networks are slow enough that the underlines lag.
- **Use a self-hosted LanguageTool for offline use.** A `docker-compose` LanguageTool image takes minutes and removes the cloud dependency.
