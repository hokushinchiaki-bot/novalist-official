# Hotkeys reference

This is the full list of default keyboard shortcuts shipped with Novalist. Every binding is **rebindable** under **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts**.

On macOS, read `Ctrl` as `Cmd` (the SDK translates accordingly).

Keys in this table use their on-screen names. A few aliases:

- `Ctrl+,` (comma) is shown as `Ctrl+OemComma` in the rebind UI.
- `Ctrl+[` and `Ctrl+]` are `Ctrl+OemOpenBrackets` and `Ctrl+OemCloseBrackets`.
- `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` are `Ctrl+D1` through `Ctrl+D9` in the rebind UI.

## Notes

- Some bindings appear twice because they are context-sensitive. `Ctrl+B` is **Toggle Explorer** when the focus is outside the editor and **Bold** when the focus is in the editor. Likewise `Ctrl+Shift+P` is the Command Palette by default, except when the Git view has focus.
- Bindings can be **cleared** entirely so they don't fire at all.
- Bindings can be **reset to default** by clicking the × next to the current binding in Settings.

## Where to go next
